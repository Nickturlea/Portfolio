<h4>Angry Birds Game</h4>
<p>This mini game is developed as a shooter based response game. You are tasked with shooting a bird at different objects with different points 
    based on size and movement. The bird being launched includes a speed bar for the user to determine the speed of their bird and a semicircular shooting area where the user can choose in 
    which direction the bird will be flying. The main goal of the game is to knock as many objects as you can with the given 3 birds.
    Level 1 consists of a easier level with bigger shooting birds, more points on objects and no moving objects.
    Level 2 consists of a harder level with smaller shooting birds, less points on objects and a final boss that moves and taunts you.
    The game tests your hand eye perception and coordination while providing a nice calm game to play around with and get the highest score.
